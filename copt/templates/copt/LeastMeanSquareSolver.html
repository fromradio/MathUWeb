	<p class = "introduction"> <span>LeastMeanSquareSolver</span> is one of the solvers of least squares problems. <span>LeastMeanSquareSolver</span> solves the least squares problems using least mean squares algorithm which is a stochastic gradient descent method. This class derives directly from another class called <span>GeneralSolver</span> and takes <span>Problem</span> and <span>Time</span> as template.</p>
